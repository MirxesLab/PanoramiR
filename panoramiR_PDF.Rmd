# Introduction
MicroRNAs (miRNAs), a group of small non-coding RNAs, are found in many species of eukaryotes. MiRNAs regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level in the cells and mediate intercellular communications when secreted into the local milieu or circulation. Dysregulation of miRNAs are implicated in pathologies of many human diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular disease and other chronic diseases [@RN6], where they function as signalling messengers to mediate cell-cell communication [@RN2]. Therefore, miRNAs hold great promise as biomarkers of human diseases [@RN3].

MiRNA expression analysis is an invaluable tool for biomarker development, which can provide important insights into the underlying mechanisms of disease development. MiRNA expression profiles can be translated into early diagnosis, risk stratification, as well as therapeutic management tools. MiRXES scientists and their collaborators have analyzed miRNAs in over 50,000 different samples across more than 20 different diseases and conditions using proprietary and patented qPCR technology. Based on extensive experience in the field of miRNA detection and analysis, MiRXES can offer a proven microRNA technology platform which can translate microRNA research into clinical applications, from biomarker discovery and validation to product development. 

**MiRXES' ID3EAL™ PanoramiR panel** is an effective approach to screening for miRNAs important in signaling pathways, disease mechanisms, or biomarker discovery for disease diagnosis and subtyping. PanoramiR targets **376 miRNAs** expertly curated from miRBase 22, HMDD 3.2 and The Cancer Genome Atlas. This is further cross-referenced with high-impact publications and in-house research data.


# Workflow Overview

376 miRNAs are detected by MiRXES's ID3EAL™ miRNA qPCR solution [@RN4]. 

\begin{minipage}{0.5\textwidth}
The ID3EAL™ miRNA qPCR solution uses a combination of a modified stem-loop oligonucleotide for reverse transcription (RT) and semi-nested PCR primers for interrogation of the synthesized complementary DNA (cDNA). The stem-loop structure of the unique RT primers stabilizes RNA-DNA hybrid, increasing efficiency in reverse-transcribing the mature miRNA. This allows highly specific detection of mature miRNAs over a large dynamic range of up to eight logs and a detection limit of zeptomole per ml amounts of miRNA (10-100 molecules). MiRNA-specific forward and reverse real-time PCR primers further confer assay specificity and enable robust amplification of amplicon.

```{r fig.align='center', out.width='100%', fig.cap='ID3EAL™ miRNA qPCR solution'}
knitr::include_graphics(png.mSMRT.qPCR)
```
\end{minipage}

 \
The workflow comprises 3 main steps – RT, pre-amplification or augmentation (AUG), followed by qPCR. Extracted RNA from each sample is subjected to multiplexed RT in 4 RT pools – A, B, C, D – and the resulting cDNA samples from each RT pool is further divided into 2 multiplexed AUG reactions (RT pool A -> Aug A1 and A2, RT pool B -> Aug B1 and B2, etc) to enhance the amount of sample input for downstream qPCR analysis. Finally the augmented cDNA is pipetted into each well of the 384-well plate containing individual qPCR miRNA assays.

# Pre-processing of Data

## Spike-in Normalization
```{r}
source('scripts/step4_Round1Filter.R')
```
miRNA spike-ins are uniquely designed small RNAs (~22 nt ) with sequences distinct from endogenous human miRNAs. These miRNA spike-ins have been extensively tested and are compatible with various isolation methods, including phenol/chloroform, phenol free, membrane, bead and precipitation based methods, provided the method retains the small RNA fraction. The use of miRNA spike-ins can monitor and normalize experimental variations in sample RNA isolation, reverse transcription and qPCR.

The miRNA spike-ins can be used in two modes: \
1. As RNA isolation control. miRNA spike-ins are added to sample lysis buffer or RNA isolation buffer before mixing with biological sample. A difference in the measured levels of miRNA spike-ins indicates varying RNA isolation yield and/or RNA purity. When used in RNA isolation, the RNA input volume to RT should be taken into consideration before spike-in Cts are used to calculate a normalization factor.

2.As reverse transcription control. miRNA spike-ins are added to RT master mix. Measured levels of miRNA spike ins allow normalization between RT reactions to detect inconsistencies between samples e.g. presence of RT-qPCR inhibitors in some samples. **If RT spike-in has Ct value greater than 30, it indicates RT reaction has failed**, and corresponding samples are removed (Please refer to the `SP_Check_Summary.xlsx` for details).

The Ct values of targeted miRNA are first normalized by miRNA spike-ins. Each sample will have a spike-in Ct corresponding to each AUG group (A1, A2, B1, B2 and so on). Each spike-in Ct values is used to calculate a spike-in factor which is added to Ct values of miRNAs in the corresponding AUG group. For the specific calculation method, please refer to the formula below.

\begin{equation}
\tag{1}
Avg.SP_{i} = \frac{\sum_{j = 1}^{n_{sample}} Ct.SP_{i,j}}{n_{sample}}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\tag{2}
SP.Factor_{i,j} = Avg.SP_{i} - SP_{i,j}
\end{equation}

1. $Avg.SP_{i}$ is the average Ct value for spike-in $i$ ($i$ = A1, A2, B1, B2, C1, C2, D1, D2), $n_{sample}$ is the number of samples. $Ct.SP_{i,j}$ is the Ct value of spike-in $i$ in sample $j$.\
2. $SP.Factor_{i}$ is the spike-in factor for spike-in $i$ in sample $j$. $SP_{i,j}$ is the Ct value of spike-in $i$ in sample $j$.

## Missing Value Imputation
```{r}
source('scripts/step7_Imputation.R')
```

### Number of miRNA Detected in Samples
The threshold Ct value is based on QC data for each specific batch of PanoramiR kit (`r min.up.limit` ~ `r cutoff.max`). MiRNAs in each samples with Ct values less than it corresponding threshold are selected for later analysis, otherwise miRNAs are considered as non-detect ; Expression figures below shows the number of detected miRNAs in each samples.

```{r fig.cap= "Number of miRNA Detected in Samples"}
p.num.miRNA # generated in step2_RSInorm.R
```

### Number of miRNA for Later Analysis
MiRNAs with missing values in more than 10% (> 10%) of the total number of samples are not analysed. Else, the missing values are imputed by the highest Ct value across the samples.\
```{r}
kableExtra::kbl(df.miss,
                format = 'latex',
                booktabs = TRUE,
                caption = "Number of missing value of miRNAs acorss samples",
                col.names = gsub("[.]", " ", names(df.miss))) %>%
  kable_styling(latex_options = c("striped", "HOLD_position"),   stripe_color = "gray!15") %>%
    footnote(general = 'Tolerable missing values across samples are no more than 10% number of samples')
```


## Global Normalization
```{r}
source('scripts/step8_GlobalNorm.R')
```

Global normalization [@RN8] is performed following spike-in normalization. A normalization constant is added to the Ct values for each miRNA in the sample so that the arithmetic mean Ct values of all the samples becomes identical.\

\begin{equation}
\tag{1}
Avg_{sample.i} = \frac{\sum_{i = 1}^{n_{miRNA}} Ct_{i}}{n_{miRNA}}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\tag{2}
Avg_{all} = \frac{\sum_{i = 1}^{n_{sample}} Avg_{sample,i}}{n_{sample}}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\tag{2}
Global.Factor_i = Avg_{all} - Avg_{sample,i}
\end{equation}

1. $Avg_{sample.i}$ is the average Ct values for sample $i$ ($n_{miRNA}$ is the number of miRNA in sample $i$)
2. $Avg_{all}$ is the average Ct values for all samples ($n_{sample}$ is the number of samples)
3. $Global.Factor_i$ is the correction factor of sample $i$ for global normalization.

## miRNA Expression Level in Each Samples {.tabset .tabset-pills}
Figure below shows the miRNA expression level in each sample. Values have been filtered based on Ct value thresholds and then spike-in as well as global normalized.

```


# MiRNA Overview
Unsupervised learning methods such as principal component analysis and clustering reduce the dimensions of the underlying differences among samples, allowing separation of observations with distinct differences. This scale of separation is often observed when there is an overall large difference among comparison groups, such as when the analysis is performed on diseased and healthy tissue samples. However, this is often not observed when the analysis is performed on blood samples, for that the miRNAs from diseased cells often represent only a minute fraction of the miRNAs content in the blood. Therefore, for blood sample, the outcome of unsupervised learning methods is expectedly to show no distinction in the observations among the comparison groups, and warrants further investigation on sample quality if clear distinction is observed.

```


## Principal Component Analysis {.tabset .tabset-pills}

p.heatmap.s2s = pheatmap(sample.dist.matrix,
                         clustering_distance_row = sample.dist,
                         clustering_distance_col = sample.dist,
                         col = colors.heatmap,
                         annotation_colors = color.anno.all,
                         annotation_col = df.anno.all,
